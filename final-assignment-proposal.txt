My idea for my final assignment is for to make a small business site for a barber shop.
The site will have two pages.
One page will have all the business' info such as pictures, services, prices. This will show of the majority of the content and styling.
The second page will be a check-in system, where customers will be able to book their place in line so they can avoid long queue times
and arrive to the shop and basically walk in through the door and into a chair.
This page will be displayed in-store where it can be seen by everyone, displaying the customer name, position in line, barber of choice and approximate wait time.
